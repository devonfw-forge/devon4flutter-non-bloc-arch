By using this technology, Learning Management System (LMS) can provide an unimpeded interaction for their users and promote awareness for any information updates. It is crucial to develop mobile application for each major mobile platform to reach most of the LMS user. In this paper, the mobile application development was done by combining native mobile technology and web technology using WebView API. This approach was taken to anticipate the need for creating and maintaining the application on multiple mobile platform and was expected to cut development time frame while retaining consistent interface and still enable platform specific's feature usage. The purpose of this study is to review the strengths and weaknesses of such combination in mobile application development specifically under android platform.},

When systems are constructed from many components, the organization of the overall system -- the software architecture -- presents a new set of design problems. This level of design has been addressed in a number of ways including informal diagrams and descriptive terms, module interconnection languages, templates and frameworks for systems that serve the needs of specific domains, and formal models of component integration mechanisms. In this paper we provide an introduction to the emerging field of software architecture. We begin by considering a number of common architectural styles upon which many systems are currently based and show how different styles can be combined in a single design. Then we present six case studies to illustrate how architectural representations can improve our understanding of complex software systems. Finally, we survey some of the outstanding problems in the field, and consider a few of the promising research directions.},

  abstract = {Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development practice in which unit test cases are incrementally written prior to code implementation. In our research, we ran a set of structured experiments with 24 professional pair programmers. One group developed code using TDD while the other a waterfall-like approach. Both groups developed a small Java program. We found that the TDD developers produced higher quality code, which passed 18\% more functional black box test cases. However, TDD developer pairs took 16\% more time for development. A moderate correlation between time spent and the resulting quality was established upon analysis. It is conjectured that the resulting high quality of code written using the TDD practice may be due to the granularity of TDD, which may encourage more frequent and tighter verification and validation. Lastly, the programmers which followed a waterfall-like process often did not write the required automated test cases after completing their code, which might be indicative of the tendency among practitioners toward inadequate testing. This observation supports that TDD has the potential of increasing the level of testing in the industry as testing as an integral part of code development.},

  title = {Hungarian Notation},
  url = {https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hungarian_notation&oldid=903388598},
  abstract = {Hungarian notation is an identifier naming convention in computer programming, in which the name of a variable or function indicates its intention or kind, and in some dialects its type. The original Hungarian Notation uses intention or kind in its naming convention and is sometimes called Apps Hungarian as it became popular in the Microsoft Apps division in the development of Word, Excel and other apps. As the Microsoft Windows division adopted the naming convention, they used the actual data type for naming, and this convention became widely spread through the Windows API; this is sometimes called Systems Hungarian notation.

Hungarian notation was designed to be language-independent, and found its first major use with the BCPL programming language. Because BCPL has no data types other than the machine word, nothing in the language itself helps a programmer remember variables' types. Hungarian notation aims to remedy this by providing the programmer with explicit knowledge of each variable's data type.
In Hungarian notation, a variable name starts with a group of lower-case letters which are mnemonics for the type or purpose of that variable, followed by whatever name the programmer has chosen; this last part is sometimes distinguished as the given name. The first character of the given name can be capitalized to separate it from the type indicators (see also CamelCase). Otherwise the case of this character denotes scope.},

  abstract = {State management refers to the management of the state of one or more user interface controls such as text fields, OK buttons, radio buttons, etc. in a graphical user interface. In this user interface programming technique, the state of one UI control depends on the state of other UI controls. For example, a state managed UI control such as a button will be in the enabled state when input fields have valid input values and the button will be in the disabled state when the input fields are empty or have invalid values. As applications grow, this can end up becoming one of the most complex problems in user interface development.This is especially the case when the state of any particular message or form on the page depends on factors outside of the current page, or available throughout several pages. For example, consider a user who is logged in and sees the 'welcome' message on their first visit to any page, but not on subsequent page visits. Does each page manage the state of the user being logged in? That would create too much copy pasting and duplication of code. Instead, you can use a state management pattern for handling messages (this may also include handling error messages and informative messages, along with the described welcome message) and then call this to receive a message as it becomes available.
Examples of state management libraries include Vuex as a state management library for the Vue.js JavaScript framework. The Angular framework includes its own library using  Observables called rxjs and Redux is a general-purpose state management library that can be used with any of the above frameworks or other view libraries, but is very commonly used with the React library. As the documentation in Redux alludes, many of these state management libraries are lightweight and can be replaced by each other. It's also possible to roll your own based on a pub-sub algorithm where your interface components (like form fields, buttons, and messages) listen to a centralized data store in your application for new changes.},

  abstract = {The current trends towards globalisation, together with the exponential growth of the number of mobile devices led the markets to a boom in the demand for the development of mobile applications. Moreover, with the expansion and heterogeneity of the mobile devices and platforms, software companies need to search for faster and cheaper ways to develop applications that are able to span as many devices as possible in order to capture the market. Currently, Android and iOS Operating Systems roughly share and dominate the mobile market, with timid expressions of other competitors. Each of these mobile operating systems was developed using their own languages and strategy and offer SDKs for development of applications using their libraries - known as native apps. On the other hand, the evolution of HTML5, CSS and JavaScript created generic alternatives to create mobile apps that run on devices on all operating systems, however lacking some capabilities to access the device's full potential. Alongside came the novel hybrid cross-platform development frameworks, which try to take the best of both worlds. Native versus hybrid platforms the trend in mobile app development using hybrid platforms and their advantage. It would not be great with just one language to develop mobile applications for all mobile devices?},

In this paper, we will enhance our previous work of cross-platform approaches by giving an overview of recent tools and platforms for each approach and discussing the advantages and limits of each one.},

  abstract = {The goal of this study was to Investigate individual differences in learning from worked-out examples with respect to the quality of self-explanations. Restrictions of former studies (e.g., lacking control of time-on-task) were avoided and additional research questions (e.g., reliability and dimensionality of self-explanation characteristics) were addressed. An investigation with 36 university freshmen students of education working in individual sessions was conducted. The domain was probability calculation. Prior knowledge and the quality of self-explanations (protocols of the individuals' thinking aloud) were assessed as predictors of learning. A post-test was employed to measure the learning gains as the dependent variable. The following main results were obtained. Most self-explanation characteristics could be regarded as relatively stable person characteristics. The individual differences in the quality of self-explanations were, however, found to be multidimensional. Most Important, even when controlling for time-on-task (quantitative aspect), learning gains could be substantially predicted by qualitative differences of self-explanation characteristics. In particular, successful learners tended to employ more prlnciplebased explanations, more explication of operator-goal combinations, and more anticipative reasoning. In addition, there were two types of effective learners, labeled anticipative reasoners and principle-based explainers.},

Visual learning is an important method for exploiting students' visual senses to enhance learning and engage their interest. This methodology also has the potential to increase the number of students in STEM fields, especially of women and minority students. A visual approach to science and engineering enhances communication. This visualization revolution shows that letting scientists engage the higher cognitive parts of the brain by thinking and communicating visually improved how they performed their research.},
